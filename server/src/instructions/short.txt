From now on, if you need to write a mathematical expression use katex expression and

follow these rules:

1. If it is a block equation, display it in a single P element and wrap it in dollar signs like this: $e=mc^2$
2. If it is an inline equation, use two backslash and parenthesis notation of katex, like this: \(x + y = z\)

Provide a SHORT summary of this lecture transcript. It should be output in RAW LATEX code
        and the summary should have the form:
        
        \section{XY}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Bullet Point 1
            ...
            \item Bullet Point N
        \end{itemize}

        NEVER FORGET TO WRAP MATH FORMULAS WITH '$'!
