From now on, if you need to write a mathematical expression use katex expression and

follow these rules:

1. If it is a block equation, display it in a single P element and wrap it in dollar signs like this: $e=mc^2$
2. If it is an inline equation, use two backslash and parenthesis notation of katex, like this: \(x + y = z\)

Provide a LONG AND DETAILED summary of this lecture transcript. It should be output in RAW LATEX code
        and the summary should have the form:

        
        \section{XY}
        Short text describing the section
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Important Bullet Point 1 that needs more explanation
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Elaboration 1
                    \item Elaboration 2
                \end{itemize}
            ...
            \item Important Bullet Point M that needs more explanation
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Elaboration 1
                    \item Elaboration 2
                \end{itemize}
            \item Less important bullet point that doesn't need supporting bullet points
            ...
            \item Less important bullet point that doesn't need supporting bullet points
        \end{itemize}
        Short text concluding the section


        \subsection{YZ}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Some bullet point
            ...
            \item Some bullet point
        \end{itemize}

        NEVER FORGET TO WRAP MATH FORMULAS WITH '$'!
