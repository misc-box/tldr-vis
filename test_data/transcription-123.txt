I have to say it's an honor to be here, this is my first ever conference talk. I did not 
imagine wearing a microphone and I did not imagine an auditorium, so I'm very, very 
honored. As you can tell, I'm going to kind of guide you through, sort of giving you an 
overview of who is a data journalist nowadays, what are the industry characteristics, 
based on a survey or two that I've carried out. Just briefly about me, I'm a PhD 
candidate at the Surrey Institute for People-Centered Artificial Intelligence. My focus 
there is really news deserts, and the research that I'm talking about today instead 
comes from work I've done while at the European Journalism Center, previously to 
starting my PhD. Aside from that, I've also worked as a data journalist at the Sheldon 
Studio, which is an information design studio in Italy, they do really cool projects, so if 
you haven't heard about them, I recommend checking them out. So without further ado, 
let's introduce the survey. The survey is called the State of Data Journalism. I don't 
know if many of you have come across this survey before, it's by datajournalism.com, 
which is a child project of the European Journalism Center, which is a non-profit that 
aims to deliver funding and training to journalists worldwide. The child project, 
datajournalism.com, is kind of a community gatherer for people interested in data 
journalism, and two years ago when I joined them, there was this kind of desire to 
create a survey that would kind of measure what's happening, give us an overview of 
this growing field. At the time, this was also felt like it was exacerbated by the pandemic, 
that it put data journalism into the spotlight, and yeah, and also we felt there was 
generally a lack of global large sample-based survey studies. There are survey studies 
about data journalism, but perhaps they tend to focus on small regions, and also they 
tend to stick within academia, so we wanted to do something that we could spread kind 
of to a global community. I think an advantage for us at data journalism to be able to do 
that was the fact that datajournalism.com has an amazing network of established 
names in the community that have contributed onto the podcast that we have, and 
written long reads for us, or contributed chapters to the handbook of data journalism, 
and then also that a lot of newcomers to the field, or people interested in the field, 
perhaps students, use datajournalism.com as a sort of learning platform and a means 
to kind of know what's happening in the community. And yeah, ultimately a desire to 
repeat this effort over time, and then be able to capture sort of over time trends. So this 
is kind of an overview of the survey. The banner at the top should have 2021 and 2022, 
that's the two editions, and the third one should say comparative elements, just for 
reference. So you can see the sample is quite large for the two surveys. The numbers in 
the brackets indicate who we actually ended up using in the analysis, and the number 
next to it is who took the survey. We ended up discarding some participants due to 
incomplete submissions, or some people somehow filing the survey twice or three 
times. We are grateful for their time, but we only wanted one questionnaire. And when it 
came to the question, it was a really lengthy questionnaire, because when you try to 
measure the field as a whole, there are so many things to kind of take into account, and 
these are the sections that we included. In the second edition of the survey, we wanted 
to add some questions about the Russia-Ukraine coverage. Specifically, it meant, for 
kind of trying to keep the questionnaire short, that we took away some questions from 
other sections. So when you look at the two surveys, there are sort of 50 questions that 
you could compare longitudinally. And when it comes to the people in the survey, we put 
a question in the second edition of saying, did you take the survey last year? And 411 
people replied that they had. When I kind of wanted to match the same person between 
the two survey editions, I was able to do that myself only for 302 individuals. In terms of 
impact, the survey has been each edition kind of the subject of a panel discussion at 
the International Journalism Festival in Perugia, and then a journal article written by 
myself and a few colleagues came out in February 2023 about the first survey. So this 
is really the first time that we look at the two in perspective and in relation to each other. 
So there are kind of two approaches I think we can adopt when it comes to longitudinal 
analysis. The first one is kind of assuming that the sampling strategy was good and 
representative enough that you can just compare the results from the first survey to the 
one of the second survey. And I think it's a good method to capture overall trends. And 
the second one is kind of what I was mentioning earlier of finding the same individual 
between the two surveys and say, okay, people replied A in 2021, but then they went on 
to reply B in 2022 and observe this kind of within individual changes. So I'm going to 
kind of give you an overview of the overall trends to begin with. The spoiler alert is that 
things were very consistent across the two editions. For me it was also comforting as a 
sort of sampling methodology. I feel like we kind of got a good substantial sample, that 
our answers were very stable. Nonetheless, a few developments were standing out. So 
starting off with the demographics, the first thing that we noticed across both editions 
was that the majority of people in the field are male. There were two out of five were 
women. This was very much the same in the two editions and it also kind of mimics 
previous findings by none other, my supervisors, Bahari and Haravi did a previous 
survey and found the same. However, women are younger and they're mostly in 
education, like a greater share of them is in education than men. So perhaps this is 
something that is going to change over the years. They're also geographically unevenly 
distributed. There is no legend there, but I can tell you that the US had the highest 
share and that's around 11% of all of the respondents. And then we had Italy and the 
UK following, Germany and Spain, we were from something like between 5% and 9%. 
And despite this being the fact, actually a little note about that, I feel perhaps many 
believe that data journalism is concentrated in countries where there are better 
resources, like organisations with better resources. But to me it was also maybe, I kind 
of put a question mark there because I think it's just harder to reach populations in 
areas where maybe data journalism doesn't have such a long tradition or where there 
are linguistical barriers in terms of reaching them. But nonetheless, we've seen some 
changes between the two editions. And the main one was that countries in Africa and 
Asia were rapidly growing at a faster pace than the countries in Europe or in North 
America, namely India and Nigeria actually entered the top five, they were sharing the 
fifth place in terms of the number of data journalists that they have, that they work 
there, whereas in 2021 the top five was just Western countries. So I think that's 
something to keep an eye out for. When it comes to employment, there's a bit of a 
gender gap in terms of leadership positions. When we surveyed, when we put out the 
survey, we asked people to kind of categorise themselves, whether they were full-time 
employees or if they were part-timers, if they were students, if they were trainers and 
educators. And when it came to team leads and editors, we saw that there were less 
women than men overall. And then generally as an industry, most people tend not to 
have been in it for a long time, over three out of five had under five years of experience. 
And another remarkable fact I thought was the fact that over one in three, if I remember
